## Configuring

WakaTime plugins share a common config file `.wakatime.cfg` located in your user home directory with [these options](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#configuring) available.

## Troubleshooting

Try running this Terminal command:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wakatime/textmate-wakatime/master/install_dependencies.sh | sh
```

That will re-download the [wakatime-cli dependency](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime).

If that doesn't work, turn on debug mode and check your wakatime cli log file (`~/.wakatime/wakatime.log`).

If there are no errors in your `~/.wakatime/wakatime.log` file, [Enable logging](https://github.com/textmate/textmate/wiki/Enable-Logging) then run TextMate from Terminal to see any error messages.
